### Details

Purpose:
We want you to create a React component that can render different forms, e.g. sign up, mailing list registration, feedback form. Given the proposed variety to support, we want to create a single component that can be easily adapted.

Details:
Create a React component that can accept a JSON-based form definition via a prop and produce a form that, in this case, can be used to collect a personâ€™s details. The form should include the following fields:

name
    text based
    should enforce the need for a first and last name (separated by a space)
date of birth
    date based
    required, should be older than 18
gender
    options based (male/female)
    optional
contact number
    text based
    optional
    allow for multiple values (e.g. mobile, home, etc)
require guardian consent
    checkbox
    optional
guardian details (name, contact)

    required/applicable if consent checkbox is ticked
